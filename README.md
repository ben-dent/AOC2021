# Advent of Code 2021 - ben-dent Solutions in Kotlin

Welcome to the Advent of Code[^aoc] Kotlin project created by [ben-dent][github] using the [Advent of Code Kotlin Template][template] delivered by JetBrains.

In this repository, I provide my solutions for the puzzles using the [Kotlin][kotlin] language. I was not aiming to be the 
fastest person to solve the problems and there may be better and more efficient ways of solving them but I will
endeavour to improve each day's solution after solving the associated puzzles for that day.

I made my solutions public as part of the [JetBrains giveaway][giveaway] but I hope others find them interesting. I am 
not a Kotlin expert so please forgive not using all the language features that could speed up my development and
solutions; it's about having fun!

[^aoc]:
    [Advent of Code][aoc] â€“ An annual event of Christmas-oriented programming challenges started December 2015.
    Every year since then, beginning on the first day of December, a programming puzzle is published every day for twenty-four days.
    You can solve the puzzle and provide an answer using the language of your choice.
